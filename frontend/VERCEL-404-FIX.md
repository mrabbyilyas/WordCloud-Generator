# üîß Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment shows as "Ready" but displays a 404 error because Vercel is trying to deploy from the repository root instead of the `frontend` folder.

## The Solution
You need to update your Vercel project settings to specify that the frontend code is in the `frontend` subdirectory.

### Option 1: Update Existing Vercel Project (Recommended)

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your `wordcloud-generator` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
4. Find the **Root Directory** setting
5. Change it from `.` (or empty) to `frontend`
6. Save the changes
7. Go to **Deployments** tab
8. Click the three dots menu on the latest deployment
9. Select **Redeploy**

### Option 2: Create New Vercel Project

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Delete the current project in Vercel
2. Create a new project
3. When importing your Git repository:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (auto-detected)

### Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://mrabbyilyas-wordcloud-generator.hf.space
```

## Why This Happened

Your repository structure is:
```
WordCloud-Generator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/    ‚Üê Your Next.js app is here
```

Vercel was looking for a Next.js app at the repository root but couldn't find one, hence the 404 error.

## Verification

After redeploying with the correct root directory:
1. The deployment should show your WordCloud Generator app
2. The Chinese language option will work perfectly
3. No more 404 errors!

**Note**: The Chinese language addition (`<SelectItem value="chinese">üá®üá≥ Chinese (Simplified)</SelectItem>`) is perfectly fine and not causing any issues. The 404 was purely a deployment configuration problem.
