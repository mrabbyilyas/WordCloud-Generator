- This folder project is a use for frontend for my project in creating wordcloud
- Please note this is very very simple project 
- The backend is using a Python and FastAPI 
- I want to use a magic ui for every component
- The magic UI MCP is ready in my IDE
- The base code for this project already use next js
- For basic run like "npm run dev" is already worked
- Make sure all the design is responsive
- no need to give navbar
- just put a hero section with the title "Word Cloud Generator"
  - and there is 1 input file .txt and also a language selection
- Put my credential in the right bottom, like my photo and my linkedin link
- use particle effect as background from magic UI "https://magicui.design/r/particles" so when i scroll down, the particle is not missing
- use smooth cursor from magic ui "https://magicui.design/r/smooth-cursor"
- use D3 wordcloud to visualize the result of the wordcloud-api
- use white background, no need for darkmode and light mode

for the API documentation please find attached wordcloud_api_json.json
